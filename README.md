## Technologies Used
- Design: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)
- Front End: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Storage: Local Storage

## Features
-  Intuitive Spell Management: Easily search, filter, and add spells to your spellbook, tailored to your character or campaign.
-  Customization Options: Create multiple spellbooks for different characters or campaigns, and mark spells as favorites for quick access.
-  Mobile Compatibility: Mobile-friendly interface, perfect for in-person gaming sessions.
- API Integration: Utilize the [D&D API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) to fetch information about spells from the official source. This ensures that your spellbook is always up-to-date with the latest rules and content additions.

## Development Stage
Currently, we have implemented functionality & user interface for the spell search, allowing users to search for spells by name. Once a search query is made, the spell's information and statistics dynamically appear in the Document Object Model (DOM), providing users with detailed insights into each spell. The next focus will be on creating the user's deck and adding the ability to add spells to said deck, which will be saved using local storage.
